Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton, which is a mathematical
model that simulates the behavior of a system over time based on a set
of rules. It was devised by the British mathematician John Conway in
1970. The Game of Life is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells,
where each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead.
