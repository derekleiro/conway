      <p>
        This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life by Derek Leiro.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton, which is a mathematical
        model that simulates the behavior of a system over time based on a set
        of rules. It was devised by the British mathematician John Conway in
        1970. The Game of Life is played on a two-dimensional grid of cells,
        where each cell can be in one of two states: alive or dead.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The game progresses in discrete time steps, and the state of each cell
        in the next time step is determined by the state of its eight
        neighboring cells in the current time step, according to the following
        rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused
          byunderpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with two or three live neighbors liveson to the next
          generation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any live cell with more than three liveneighbors dies, as if by
          overpopulation.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell,
          as if by reproduction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Game of Life was created as a thought experiment to explore the idea
        of how complex patterns and behaviors can emerge from a simple set of
        rules
